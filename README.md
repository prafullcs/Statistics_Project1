**Problem Statement**

In the fast-paced taxi booking sector, maximizing revenue is crucial for long-term success and driver satisfaction. 
The objective is to leverage data-driven insights to optimize revenue streams for taxi drivers. 
The primary research focus is on the relationship between payment type and fare amount.


**Research Question**

Is there a relationship between total fare amount and payment type?
Can customers be nudged towards payment methods that generate higher revenue for drivers without negatively impacting their experience?

**Methodology**

**Description Analysis :**
Performed statistical analysis to summarize key aspects of the data, focusing on fare amounts and payment types.

**Hypothesis Testing :**
Conducted a T-test to evaluate the relationship between payment type and fare amount, testing the hypothesis that different payment methods influence fare amounts.

**Regression Analysis :**
Implemented linear regression to explore the relationship between trip duration (calculated from pickup and dropoff times) and fare amount.


**Journey Insights**
- Card vs. Cash Payments: Customers paying with cards tend to have slightly higher average trip distances and fare amounts compared to those paying with cash. This indicates that customers prefer to pay more with - cards for high fare amounts and long trip distances.

**Preference of Payment Types**
- Card Payments: 67.5% of all transactions.
- Cash Payments: 32.5% of all transactions.
This strong preference for card payments is potentially due to convenience, security, and incentives offered for card transactions.

**Passenger Count Analysis**
 - Card Payments: Rides with a single passenger (passenger count = 1) constitute 40.08% of all card transactions.
-  Cash Payments: Single-passenger rides make up 20.04% of all cash transaction.

 There is a noticeable decrease in the percentage of transactions as the passenger count increases, suggesting larger groups are less likely to use taxis or may opt for alternative payment methods. These insights emphasize the importance of considering both payment method and passenger count when analyzing transaction data to understand customer behavior and preferences better.

**Hypothesis Testing**

- Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.
- Alternative Hypothesis: There is a difference in average fare between customers who use credit cards and customers who use cash.
With a T statistic of 165.5 and a p-value less than 0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected, suggesting a significant difference in average fare between the two payment methods.

**Recommendations**
- Encourage Credit Card Payments: To capitalize on the potential for generating more revenue for taxi drivers, encourage customers to pay with credit cards.
Incentives for Credit Card Transactions: Implement strategies such as offering incentives or discounts for credit card transactions to promote this payment method.
Enhance Payment Options: Provide seamless and secure credit card payment options to enhance customer convenience and encourage the adoption of this preferred payment method.

**Conclusion**
By understanding the relationship between payment type and fare amount, taxi services can implement strategies to maximize revenue. Encouraging credit card payments through incentives and improved payment infrastructure can lead to increased revenue for drivers while maintaining a positive customer experience.
